          I highly recommend Jesdel! I took on a whole house remodeling project,
          and had a fully loaded (actuall a bit overloaded) 200A panel. Jesus
          upgraded the whole system for me in a seamless fashion. He coordinated
          it with Oncore, and the house was only without power for half a day!
          That's pretty impressive considering he swapped out the meter, added 2
          disconnects, and gave me 2 full sized 200A panels (320 service) - with
          room to grow. I have no reservations in recommending his services.

          Jesdel Electric is an honest and professional company. I had two flood
          lights that did not work. The owner came to diagnose within a few days
          of our initial call (they are very busy) and within the first 20
          minutes of them looking at my lights they found the problem and fixed
          it. The second light required deeper diagnosis and more work. I was
          quoted a very reasonable price for the amount of work it was going to
          take to fix the second light. I am delighted with their work, the
          price and the time it took to fix. I would definitely recommend them
          and if I ever have another electrical issue or need to install
          anything electrical I will be giving them a call.

          Had a complicated outlet install. Jesus and team first came to inspect
          before they came back to complete the work. Quick and efficient and no

          same time. Highly recommend!!

          Jesus was wonderful to work with. As a first time homeowner who’d
          bought a 1960’s home, I was overwhelmed with all the updates needed
          including replacing and relocating the electric panel. It became
          evident early on that my home was in good hands- Jesus treats each
          customer’s home the way he would a friend’s or family member’s. I also
          really appreciated how responsive he was throughout the project, as I
          unabashedly pummeled him with newbie questions.
